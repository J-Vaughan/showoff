# showoff

A personal website to show off what I'm into. Initially I was going to go
all-out on this, making my own platform in Rust, but seeing as I'm not in
software engineering (I'm in Aerospace), ease (and speed) of development
seems much more important. Besides, I don't want to build websites, I want to
build defence systems.

Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
```

## Production

We're just going to let DigitalOcean App Platform handle this.

```bash
# npm
npm run build
```

Check out the [deployment documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for more information.
